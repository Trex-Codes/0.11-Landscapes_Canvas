# Landscapes_Canvas
## _Geometric designs based on natural landscapes using `Canvas`_

## Starting 🎨
_it is made up of two branches which each have a special design but having the same base (Mountains)_.
It has a similarity with the project [0.9-HighWay-ColorStreet](https://github.com/Trex-Codes/0.9-HighWay-ColorStreet) which has a similar aesthetic with `Canvas`

## Deployment 🔌
_Each design has the use of Canvas in addition to using gradient for the colors or tones of each structure, using `JS`_

1. **Mountains_Canvas**
_This branch has a basic design about the landscape, only the minimalist structure of five mountains each with a decoration at the top and a gradient of various colors.
and in the lower zone it is a gradient on a type of sea or water under them_

2. **Forest_Canvas**
_This branch has a more specialized and complex landscape design since it has straight and curved mountains, it also has trees of different shapes and sizes,
and at the bottom is a small lake. All colors were made by means of gradients or RGBA_
